## ‚≠ê How It's Built

This was built from scratch with React and TailwindCSS, which includes a light/dark theme toggle. Using MDX content, static pages are generated with Gatsby and GraphQL. Automatically deploys to netlify, with routing on AWS Route53 for the domain.

Using Figma, I created the designs to follow and basic component layout of the site:
